# Grouped 

Grouped is one page app that allows users to add, edit and delete a list people as well as add, edit and delete a list of groups with the goal of assigning people to the various groups. The data is stored on Firebase's firestore and any update made is synchronistically  displayed on all open instances of the app in real time. 

This project was built using HTML, CSS, React, Sass and Firebase's very cool platform.
